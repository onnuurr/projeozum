# Developing the Bagisto API package

Use this when you are working **inside** the `bagisto-api` package (`packages/Webkul/BagistoApi`, namespace `Webkul\BagistoApi`) — installing it, removing it, adding or changing an endpoint/resource, or fixing package behaviour. This is the guide rails: it tells you where the authoritative spec is, the rules you must not break, and points you at the detailed references.

## CRITICAL — install / remove only when asked

**Installing or removing the package is NEVER an automatic action.** Detecting the package files, a `composer.json`, or a Bagisto project does **not** mean you should install, reinstall, optimise, or uninstall anything. Only perform install (`reference/install.md`) or removal (`reference/uninstall.md`) when the **client explicitly asks for it**, and for install, ask whether they want the **Composer (stable)** or **Manual (newest)** method first.

## Authoritative sources — read these FIRST

The package ships its own complete documentation. **Read the relevant part before writing code** — almost every menu/resource is already specified with its exact behaviour, validation, events, and quirks:

| Source | What it gives you |
|--------|-------------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` (package root) | The authoritative conventions + a coverage table for **every** endpoint, with the per-resource decisions and quirks. **Read this first** for the resource you're touching. |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/` | Design specs for larger features. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | What shipped, consumer-facing, under `[Unreleased]`. |
| `PERFORMANCE.md` | Caching / IRI / schema-build performance notes. |
| GitHub `bagisto/bagisto-api` | The canonical code — copy the closest existing resource rather than writing the pattern from scratch. |
| `https://api-docs.bagisto.com` (+ `/llms.txt`) | The consumer-facing request/response shapes + the full endpoint index. |

**Rule: don't improvise behaviour that `CLAUDE.md` already specifies.** Search it for the resource/menu first.

## Reference map — open the one you need

| Topic | Reference file | Use when |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Install the package | `reference/install.md` | Client asks to install / set up the API |
| Remove the package | `reference/uninstall.md` | Client asks to remove / uninstall the package |
| Where files go | `reference/structure.md` | Adding any file; finding the right directory + base class |
| Surfaces, transports, declaring a resource | `reference/api-structure.md` | Designing a new endpoint; understanding the 5-file pattern + feature surface |
| Coding standards + checklist | `reference/conventions.md` | Writing/reviewing a resource against the rules |
| Foot-guns | `reference/precautions.md` | Before you ship — the things that silently break |
| What the API will / won't do | `reference/limitations.md` | Scoping a feature; deciding "do we support this?" |
| Tests + cache cycle | `reference/testing.md` | Running/adding tests; the cache commands |

## The 5-file pattern (the spine of every resource)

Model (`#[ApiResource]` — REST + GraphQL ops + OpenAPI block) → DTO (typed input) → Provider (read path) → Processor (write path) → lang (`src/Resources/lang/en/app.php`). Storefront resources live under `src/`; admin resources under `src/Admin/`. **Tag every Provider/Processor in `BagistoApiServiceProvider::register()`** — an untagged one is silently bypassed (404 / wrong data). Full detail in `reference/api-structure.md` and `reference/structure.md`.

## The two non-negotiables

1. **A REST change can break GraphQL** — they share the same Provider/Processor. **Always run the resource's GraphQL test before the REST test**, and confirm it's green before considering the change done. This is the single most important rule.
2. **Parity with the Bagisto admin panel, not a superset.** Mirror what the admin UI does; where core lacks a feature, block the gap with a clear error rather than half-extending. See `reference/limitations.md`.

Everything else — the full checklist, the ranked foot-guns, and the test/cache commands — is in the references above. Open them rather than guessing.
